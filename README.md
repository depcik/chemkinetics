# chemkinetics
This effort highlights the development of an adaptable, user customizable, and free open-source software tool to evaluate reaction kinetics in combustion models. What we wanted to do was to provide students new to the field a tool that they could use to understand homogeneous combustion kinetics. Thus, we compared Chemkin, Cantera, and kinetics programmed by hand. Not surprisingly, they all provided the same results.
